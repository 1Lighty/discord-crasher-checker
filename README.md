# Discord Crasher Checker

Quickly (as quickly as it can and as quick as your internet is) checks over GIFV's and videos to make sure they won't crash your Discord.

This is effective against almost all crashers that I am aware of, if you notice one slipping past, please let me know privately via DMs so I can take a look.
